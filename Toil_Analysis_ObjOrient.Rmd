## Making Cancer Predictions on Breast RNA-Seq Samples

This particular document takes the Toil-normalized TCGA and GTEx breast cancer samples and runs the logistic regression algorithm with lasso regularizer on them.  Importantly, the only sample-to-sample normalization performed in quantile-quantile normalization relative to a single reference sample.  No batch normalization is performed at this point,  as it's the simplest scenario for test samples processed in the clinic, as they will appear one at a time, typically.

The data were downloaded from the UCSC server at:
https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20TARGET%20GTEx&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443
There are 2 relevant *gene expression RNAseq* datasets there.  *RSEM expected_count (n=19,109)* which is used in this document, and *RSEM expected_count (DESeq2 standardized) (n=19,039)* which was used in the *Toil_Norm.Rmd* file.


The *markdown* and *html* versions of this document have some of the code masked for better readability.  To view the full code, see the [.Rmd version](Toil_Analysis_ObjOrient.Rmd).

#### Setting Global Parameters
For this code to run, one must set the path, on one's machine to the *RSEM_COUNTS_FILE*, which contains the RNASeq data, and the *TOILGENEANNOT* file, which maps the Ensembl identifiers to the gene names.

There are 3 large functions that don't appear in the .md and .html versions of this document to improve readability: one pre-processes the Toil_RSEM data, one performs TMM sample-to-sample scaling, just like the edgeR method, and the last centers and scales each gene relative to its mean and standard deviation.

## MAIN  
The RSEM-Counts file originated as the full set of GTEX and TCGA breast samples, both healthy and tumors, which numbered over 1200.  I wanted an equal number of tumor and healthy samples in my training and test set, as it gave me the best chance at seeing how well my predictor performed.  Further, some samples had been found by the Sloan-Kettering group to be of low quality, and these were filtered out.  These steps were performed by another script (Toil_RSEM.Rmd).  Our starting dataframe here, is therefore called *toilSubset*, and has 387 samples.
```{r}
# just read already-subsetted dataframe
toilSubset <- read.table(RSEM_COUNTS_FILE, sep="\t", header=TRUE)
rownames(toilSubset) <- toilSubset$sample
```
### RSEM-Counts Dataframe Cleanup
I'm going to add the gene name to the Ensembl ID to make it easier to figure out what genes we're looking at.  Samples were also sorted in the dataframe so that healthy and tumors were separated, as subsequently were TCGA and GTEX.
```{r}
toilSubset <- preProcess(toilSubset, TOILGENEANNOT)
```
### Create Test and Training Sets
Up to this point, all we've done is grabbed the Toil RSEM output data and re-formatted it.  It's still in log2-format.

Next:    
1. Randomly select samples to be in the training and test sets in a way that
keeps the ratio of healthy/tumors at about 50/50  
2. Filter out genes with very low or zero expression across the data set.  
3. perform edgeR normalization with a reference sample to control for depth-of-sequencing effects.  Use same reference for training and (future) test set  
4. Center and scale each gene about its mean and std deviation, respectively.    
5. Perform ML  
6. Test the model on the test set.  

```{r}
toilSubsetWide <- t(toilSubset)                               # transpose matrix

outcome <- c(rep(0, 185), rep(1, 197))                  # 0 = healthy, 1 = tumor

# bind outcome variable on data frame for even, random partitioning
toilSubsetWide <- data.frame(cbind(toilSubsetWide, outcome))
set.seed(SEED)
idxTrain <- caTools::sample.split(toilSubsetWide$outcome, SplitRatio = 0.75)
# QA
sum(idxTrain)/length(idxTrain)             # 75% observations in training set OK
```
We see that 75% of the samples ended up in the training set, as expected.
```{r}
# create training and test predictor sets and outcome vectors:
toilTrain <- subset(toilSubsetWide, idxTrain==TRUE)
outcomeTrain <- subset(toilSubsetWide$outcome, idxTrain==TRUE)  # Is this used?

toilTest <- subset(toilSubsetWide, idxTrain==FALSE)
outcomeTest <- subset(toilSubsetWide$outcome, idxTrain==FALSE)

# remove outcome variable from predictor matrices:
toilTrain <- toilTrain %>% dplyr::select(-outcome)
toilTest <- toilTest %>% dplyr::select(-outcome)

# convert back to matrices:
toilTrain <- as.matrix(toilTrain)
toilTest <- as.matrix(toilTest)

# reclaim memory
rm(toilSubset); rm(toilSubsetWide)
```
Now create object starting with toilTrain data matrix
```{r}
train <- createDAT(toilTrain)
train$M_nat <- natural(train)
train$outcome <- outcomeTrain
```
### 1. Removing genes whose expression is very close to zero.  
We know that there are about 9103 genes that are never expressed (data not shown), but there are over 25000 genes whose 75th quantile-level expression is under 2^(0.2) - 1 = 0.14 counts. We really don't want to deal with those genes in selecting a reference sample, etc.
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
hist(apply(toilTrain, 2, function(x) quantile(x)[4]), breaks=100, main="Histogram of each gene's 75th quantile of expression.", xlab="log2(Est Counts)")
```
Another attempt at filtering genes whose log2(Est Counts) was less than 5 gave very unstable results at the sample-to-sample scaling factor step that corrects for unequal depth-of-sequencing between samples (not shown here).  The exact reason for this hasn't been pursued at this point.  One possibility is that samples whose depth-of-sequencing is low may have most of their genes absent for the sample-to-sample adjustment step.

```{r}
tmp <- filterGenes(train)
train$ZEROGENES <- tmp[[1]]; train$M_filt <- tmp[[2]]
```
### 2. Sample-to-Sample Scaling
I'm using the TMM algorithm to perform sample-to-sample scaling, just as what is done in edgeR.  First, one picks a reference sample (whose depth-of-sequencing is close to the median), then one scales all other samples relative to it, using weighted Trimmed Mean (TMM).
```{r}
tmp <- pickRefSample(train)
train$M_scaled <- tmp[[2]]; train$RefSampleName <- tmp[[1]]
train$M_filtScaled <- weightedTrimmedMean(train, NULL, 0)    ## re-modify

edgeR_scalingFactors <- edgeR::calcNormFactors(t(train$M_filt),method="TMM") #edgeR method, but need
# way of feeding it a reference sample
# apply(train[[3]], 2, function(x) x * edgeR_scalingFactors)
```
### 3. Gene-level Normalization
When performing lasso regularization, it's important that the each gene is on the same scale as all other genes.  Otherwise, highly expressed genes will influence the algorithm more than other genes.  And with differential expression, we're not interested in the absolute expression level in any case.  So here, we subtract each gene's mean and divide by the gene's standard deviation so that each gene is standard-normalized.
```{r}
train$M_norm <- normalizeGenes(train$M_filtScaled, TRUE, FALSE)
```
#### train$M_norm is what we'll perform our machine learning on.

### Logistic Regression with Lasso Regularizer on Toil Data
I'd like to compare the performance on this breast cancer dataset in the absence of batch normalization (ComBat).  This helps rule out any bias the batch normalization may have had on improving the previous prediction results, which were much better than I'd expected.  

INSERT EQUATION HERE

```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)
fitToil.lasso <- glmnet(train$M_norm, train$outcome, family="binomial",
                           alpha = 1)
plot(fitToil.lasso, xvar="lambda", label=TRUE)

```
Here, we see which genes have the strongest effect on the logistic regression model as the value of lambda increases from left to right.  It appears that perhaps with a few dozen genes, we might have a well-performing model.

### Cross-Validating the Model to Pick the Smallest, Well-Performing Model
I'm going to look at cross-validating the model in order to pick the simplest one that performs well.
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)                                # need same seed as previous step
cv.Toil.lasso <- cv.glmnet(train$M_norm, train$outcome
                           , family="binomial", alpha=1) 
plot(cv.Toil.lasso)
```
We can see that 42 predictors gives us a model whose deviance is within 1-standard deviation from the minimum.  

### Store the Model in a Custom Structure
```{r}

coefsToil <- coef(cv.Toil.lasso, s=cv.Toil.lasso$lambda.1se)

##########
# Store model in a structure:
storeMODEL <- function(coefsToil, train=train){
   idx <- which(coefsToil[,1] != 0)
   predictorFullNames <- rownames(coefsToil)[idx]
   colIDs <- which(colnames(train$M_norm) %in% 
                   predictorFullNames) 
   tmpDF <- train$M_norm[,colIDs]
   predGeneNames <- gsub("\\.ENSG.*","", predictorFullNames)
   colnames(tmpDF) <- predGeneNames[2:length(predGeneNames)]

   z <- list(
      fullModel = coefsToil,
      predFullNames = predictorFullNames,
      predCoefs = coefsToil[idx],
      predGeneNames = predGeneNames, 
      predEntrezID = gsub(".*.(ENSG.*)\\..*$","\\1", predictorFullNames),
      modelDF = tmpDF                                 # lacks (Intercept)
   )
   
   class(z) <- "MODEL"
   return(z)
}

LogRegModel <- storeMODEL(coefsToil, train)

```
## Working with Test Data  

### Filter and Scale Test Data.  
#### Relying on Training Data for Zero-Filtering and Scaling of Test Data  
In order to see how well our model actually performs, we need to test it on test data that it hasn't seen before.  First, we need to process the test data just as we did the training data, but completely separately, as this is the real-world case.  

In data not shown here, I have found that sample-to-sample scaling performs well only when either  
(i) it's done in the context of a large number of samples, which is a challenge for the real-world case where a single sample comes out of the clinic.  
(ii) it's done relative to a single *reference sample* that was identified in the training set.  

Here, I'm using case (ii) by normalizing each test sample individually against this reference sample.  Towards the bottom of the document, I perform case (i) below in order to rule out any lingering bias derived from the fact that sample scaling is performed relative to a single training sample.  

Furthermore, the process of filtering out genes with very-near-zero expression levels across all samples cannot be easily defined by a single clinical sample.  Likewise, here, I'll use the "(near) zero-expressed genes" from the training set in order to perform gene-level filtering in the test set.  

We start by entering the test data into a new instance of our **DAT** object.
```{r}
test <- createDAT(toilTest)               # add matrix to DAT object
test$M_nat <- natural(test)                # transform from log2 to natural scale
test$outcome <- outcomeTest                  # add outcome variable
```
#### 1. Filter out genes from test set using those defined in the training set
```{r}
                                               # transfer ZEROEXP to test object
test$M_filt <- test$M_nat[, -train$ZEROGENES]  # subtract off genes and return 
                                               # remainder to test object
```
#### 2. Sample-to-Sample Scaling of Test Set
We're going to use the Reference Sample data from the training set here  
```{r}
tmp <- pickRefSample(test)                  # only doing this to get scaled data
test$M_scaled <- tmp[[2]]; 
test$RefSampleName <- train$RefSampleName      # RefSampleName from training set
test$M_filtScaled <- weightedTrimmedMean(test, train, 1)     # filtered & scaled
```
#### 3. Gene-level Normalization on Test Set

```{r}
test$M_norm <- normalizeGenes(test$M_filtScaled, TRUE, FALSE)
```
#### 4. Remove Non-Predictor Genes from Filtered Test Data
We're just keeping the 42 predictors from toilTestFiltScaled
```{r}
colIDs <- which(colnames(test$M_norm) %in% 
                   LogRegModel$predFullNames[2:length(LogRegModel$predFullNames)])
toilTestFiltScal42 <- test$M_norm[,colIDs]                    # SEPARATE FROM OBJECT
```
#### 5. Test Set Sensitivity and Specificity
First we add an intercept column to test predictor variables, then we perform
matrix multiplication with the predictor coefficients and then look at the 
prediction performance in the confusion matrix.
```{r}
toilTestFiltScal42 <- cbind(rep(1,nrow(toilTestFiltScal42)), toilTestFiltScal42)

testPredictions_toil <- ifelse(toilTestFiltScal42 %*% LogRegModel$predCoefs > 0, 1, 0)
table(test$outcome, testPredictions_toil)
```
I'm at 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

```{r, include=F}
# reclaim memory
rm(toilTrain, toilTest, tmp)
```
## Why does the model perform so well?
I expected that the logistic regression with a lasso regularizer would perform okay, but not nearly as well as it did.  The question is why?  Is it simply that tumors have a sufficiently different genetic programming that they can easily be partitioned from healthy samples?  

### Principal Components
To explore this idea, I'm going to look at the first 2 principal components of the overall variability of the data across all genes that weren't filtered out for having near-zero expression, and plot those out, coloring each sample according to whether or not it's healthy or a tumor.  
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, dpi=300}

plotPCs <- function(dfComponents, compIdx){
   PC_plot <- data.frame(x=dfComponents[,compIdx[1]], y = dfComponents[,compIdx[2]], col=prognosis)
   colors3pal <- c("#FDAE6B", "#E6550D",  "#56B4E9")
   obj <<- ggplot(PC_plot) + 
      geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color=as.factor(col)), alpha=0.6) + 
      ggtitle("PCA Plot of Training Data Using All Filtered Predictors of Toil Training Data") +
      xlab(paste0("PC",compIdx[1])) + ylab(paste0("PC", compIdx[2])) +
      theme_bw() + 
      scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                         breaks = c("1", "2", "3"),
                         values = c(colors3pal[1], colors3pal[2], colors3pal[3]),
                         labels = c("Healthy-GTEX", "Healthy-TCGA", "Cancer-TCGA"));
   return(obj)
}


prognosis <- c(rep(1, 59), rep(2,80), rep(3, 148))       # 1/2 = healthy, 3 = cancer
PCs <- prcomp(train$M_norm)                               # (data already scaled)
nComp <- 2           
dfComponents <- predict(PCs, newdata=train$M_norm)[,1:nComp]

# capture 'prognosis' and 'dfComponents' as file to be used in Shiny App
# trainSmpPCsProg <- cbind(dfComponents, prognosis)
# write.table(trainSmpPCsProg, "BRCAtrainSmplsPCProg.txt", sep=",")

PC_plot <- data.frame(x=dfComponents[,1], y = dfComponents[,2], col=prognosis)
colors3pal <- c("#FDAE6B", "#E6550D",  "#56B4E9")

ggplot(PC_plot) + 
   geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color=as.factor(col))) + 
   ggtitle("PCA Plot of Training Data Using All Filtered Predictors of Toil Training Data") +
   xlab("PC1") + ylab("PC2") + theme_bw() +
   scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                      breaks = c("1", "2", "3"),
                      values = c(colors3pal[1], colors3pal[2], colors3pal[3]),
                      labels = c("Healthy-GTEX", "Healthy-TCGA", "Cancer-TCGA"))
```
    
We can see that even only employing the first 2 Principal Components, that:  
(1) there is very good separation between the tumors in the training set (blue) and the healthy samples.  

(2) We also see that the 2nd PC separates the outcome variable much better than the 1st PC.  

(3) We also notice that the healthy samples from TCGA (red) and the healthy samples from GTEX (orange) are also separated out.  This has to do with how there's a batch effect between TCGA and GTEX and which was addressed by the Sloan Kettering group in the [Wang, et. al. Combat paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201861).  Earlier work of mine on the Wang batch-corrected version of this dataset also performed well with the logistic regression with lasso model (not shown here).  However, I have focused on the pre-batch corrected version here, because batch correcting would probably be difficult to implement for clinical samples.  

In light of the PC plot, it perhaps should not be surprising that an off-the-shelf algorithm would perform so well, as the variability in transcription is quite significant between healthy samples and tumors.  It might be that after tissue type, healthy/tumor may impact variability in transcription more than any other factor.  

### Top 5 Principal Components
I wanted to see if any other of the top PCs were good at separating healthy samples from tumors.  
```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, dpi=300}
plotPCs_1d <- function(dfComponents, color){
   PC_plot <- data.frame(x=dfComponents$Var2, y = dfComponents$value, col=color)
   colors3pal <- c("#FDAE6B", "#E6550D",  "#56B4E9")
   obj <- ggplot(PC_plot) + 
      geom_jitter(aes(x=x, y=y, color=as.factor(col)), alpha=0.7) + 
      ggtitle("Separation of Healthy / Tumors by First Few PC's") +
      xlab("PC Number") + ylab("PC Projection") +
      theme_bw() +
      scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                         breaks = c("1", "2", "3"),
                         values = c(colors3pal[1], colors3pal[2], colors3pal[3]),
                         labels = c("Healthy-GTEX", "Healthy-TCGA", "Cancer-TCGA"));
   return(obj)
}


nComp <- 5
dfComponents <- predict(PCs, newdata=train$M_norm)[,1:nComp]

dfCompMelt <- melt(dfComponents)
plotPCs_1d(dfCompMelt, prognosis)
```
We see that the 2nd and 3rd PCs give pretty good outcome variable separation.  Let's look at pairwise PC plots.
```{r, fig.height=14, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
ls <- list()
pairs <- combn(5,2)
for(idx in 1:dim(pairs)[2]){
   pair <- pairs[,idx]
   ls[[idx]] <- plotPCs(dfComponents, pair)                  # Add a MAIN TITLE and remove other titles
}
grid.arrange(ls[[1]], ls[[2]], ls[[3]], ls[[4]], ls[[5]], ls[[6]],
             ls[[7]], ls[[8]], ls[[9]], ls[[10]], ncol=2)
```
It appears that PC2 and PC2 together perhaps give the best separation.

```{r, include=F}
rm(PCs, dfCompMelt, dfComponents)
```
### What Genes are the Model Predictors?
I'm going to pull the definition and symbols for the 42 predictors in the model from *biomaRt* to see what genes the predictors are.  The following table is sorted from the gene predictor that has the coefficient with the greatest (absolute) magnitude to the predictor with the least magnitude.
```{r}
# get predictor gene names and Ensembl IDs while removing Intercept term:
ensembl_geneID <- LogRegModel$predEntrezID[2:length(LogRegModel$predEntrezID)]
predictorGeneNames <- LogRegModel$predGeneNames[2:length(LogRegModel$predGeneNames)]
modelCoefs <- LogRegModel$predCoefs[2:length(LogRegModel$predCoefs)]
ensembl_coefs <- data.frame(ensembl_geneID, modelCoefs, abs(modelCoefs)) 

##############
# we'll grab biomaRt data for these genes.  
# The following block of code is ONLY
# RUN ONCE, and the results are stored in a file.
if(FALSE){                                         # rm this line the first time
listMarts()
ensembl=useMart("ensembl")
ensembl = useDataset("hsapiens_gene_ensembl",mart=ensembl)

geneID_Name_Description <- getBM(attributes=c("ensembl_gene_id", "hgnc_id", 
                                              "hgnc_symbol", "description"),
   values=geneNames,
   mart=ensembl)
write.csv(geneID_Name_Description, file=BIOMART_GENE_ATTR_FILE)
}
#############

Ensmbl_HGNC_SYM_DESC <- read.csv(BIOMART_GENE_ATTR_FILE, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = F)
predGeneAnnot <- Ensmbl_HGNC_SYM_DESC %>% dplyr::filter(ensembl_gene_id %in% ensembl_geneID) 
# join with ensembl-coeff df-abs coeff
rm(Ensmbl_HGNC_SYM_DESC)
joinedAnnot <- inner_join(predGeneAnnot, ensembl_coefs, by=c("ensembl_gene_id" = "ensembl_geneID"))
# arrange by order to desc abs coeff and print select columns:
joinedAnnot$description <- gsub(" \\[.*$","",joinedAnnot$description) # %>% substr(1,40)
modelAnnot <- as_tibble(joinedAnnot %>% arrange(desc(abs.modelCoefs.)) %>% dplyr::select("ensembl_gene_id", 
                                                          "hgnc_symbol", "modelCoefs",
                                                          "description"))
modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol[15] <- "RP5.1039K5.17"; modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol[40] <- "CTD"
print(modelAnnot, n=42)
```
Of the 42 predictors, 3 are anti-sense RNAs, 1 pseudogene: (CNTNAP3 pseudogene 2), 1 non-protein coding gene,
1 micro RNA, and the others being protein-coding genes.    

### Expression of the 42 Predictors Across Healthy Samples and Tumors
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
require(reshape2)
trainNorm42predictors <- train$M_norm[,colIDs]
#print(cbind(geneNames, colnames(trainNorm42predictors)))
# need to shorten names and print those gene names vertically
colnames(trainNorm42predictors) <- predictorGeneNames  # simplify predictor names   
colors3pal <- c("#FDAE6B", "#E6550D",  "#56B4E9")
predict42scaledMelt <- melt(trainNorm42predictors)
predict42scaledMelt <- cbind(predict42scaledMelt , colr=as.factor(rep(prognosis, 42)))
ggplot(predict42scaledMelt, aes(x=Var2, y=value)) + #, colour=colr)) +
   geom_jitter(aes(colour=colr), size=0.5, alpha=0.75) +
   theme_bw() +
   ylim(-2,5) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90)) +
   xlab("Gene Predictors") + ylab("Number of STDEV of Expression vs Mean") +
   scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                         breaks = c("1", "2", "3"),
                         values = c(colors3pal[1], colors3pal[2], colors3pal[3]),
                         labels = c("Healthy-GTEX", "Healthy-TCGA", "Cancer-TCGA"))
```
We can see that the majority of these gene predictors have either a higher level of expression in tumors (positive coefficient) or a higher level of expression in healthy tissues (negative coefficient).  2 genes seem to disciminate poorly--at least on their own.  I thought they might all have coefficients very close to zero.  However, they are mid-to-high range (RP5.1039K5.17 = 0.140 and TRBV11-2 = 0.124).  Beyond this basic point, I haven't pursued this.    


### Using 2 genes to separate out healthy and tumor samples
I'm going to use MIR497HG and PAFAH1B3 to create a 2D plot of the samples colored by their healthy / tumor status.  I'm choosing these two because they have large coefficients in the model and because they are inversely correlated with one another.
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
df03 <- LogRegModel$modelDF[,c("PAFAH1B3", "MIR497HG")]    # BGN
df03 <- data.frame(cbind(df03, col=as.factor(prognosis)))
ggplot(df03) +
   geom_point(aes(x=PAFAH1B3,y=MIR497HG,colour=as.factor(col))) +
   theme_bw() +
    #ylim(-2,5) + #theme_bw() + # (axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90)) +
   scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                         breaks = c("1", "2", "3"),
                         values = c(colors3pal[1], colors3pal[2], colors3pal[3]),
                         labels = c("Healthy-GTEX", "Healthy-TCGA", "Cancer-TCGA"))
```
We can see that 2 genes with coefficients that are large, but of opposite sign, nearly create a separating hyperplane between the tumors and the healthy samples.  This recapitulates the earlier idea of how the gene expression programming of tumors have greatly diverged from that of healthy samples that we saw with the Principal Components plots.

### Heatmap
```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=10}
samples <- factor(prognosis)
sampleCols <- palette(colors3pal)[samples]           # set color of sample class

# for the gene-column to be color-coded by the value of its coefficient,
# the coefficients must be placed in the same order they appear in in the 
# LogRegModel$modelDF dataframe.  modelAnnot$modelCoefs are where the coefficients
# reside initially.

geneCoefs <- data.frame(modelAnnot$modelCoefs)
rownames(geneCoefs) <- modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol

# QA: columns not matching
# colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[!(colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF) %in% modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol)]
# modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol[!(modelAnnot$hgnc_symbol %in% colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF))]

# manually cleaning these up -- later the gene names should be derived from a common source
colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[2] <- gsub("\\.", "-", colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[2])
colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[11] <- gsub("\\.", "-", colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[11])
colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[13] <- "CTD"
colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[17] <- "CAVIN2"
colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF)[31] <- "LINC02580"

geneCoefsMatrixOrder <- geneCoefs[colnames(LogRegModel$modelDF),]    #reordering
range01 <- function(x)(x-min(x))/diff(range(x))
geneCols <- palette(brewer.pal(11,"Spectral"))[cut(range01(geneCoefsMatrixOrder), breaks=11, labels=FALSE)]

hmcol <- colorRampPalette(c("#40004B", "#40004B", "#40004B", "#762A83", "#9970AB", 
  "#F7F7F7", "#5AAE61", "#1B7837", "#00441B", "#00441B", "#00441B"))
heatmap.2(as.matrix(LogRegModel$modelDF), col=hmcol, trace="none", cexRow = 0.15, cexCol = 0.5,  
          ColSideColors = geneCols, RowSideColors = sampleCols, main = "Heatmap of Gene Predictors vs Samples")
```
The heatmap just provides another way at looking at the closeness of relationship between the different gene predictors and likewise between the different samples.  The color-coding of the columns and rows has a bug in it at the moment.  

## Testing the Model Sensitivity on More RNASeq Samples
When the initial dataset of 382 samples were obtained from GTEX and TCGA, there were far more tumors available than healthy samples.  All healthy samples were part of these 382 samples which were then split into 287 training samples and 95 test samples.  

However, there remain many more RNA-Seq samples from TCGA that have not yet been used in this study.  I'd like to see how the model performs on them, and since there are so many, I thought that I'd first break them into their stage of cancer (I - IV) and test them in those groups.  Since all of these samples are tumors, we'll further be measuring the sensitivity of the model.  But since there are no healthy samples, we'll be unable to measure the specificity.  

Another point that I'll bring up is that in creating the set of 382 from an initial group of 398 samples, there was a filtering step where samples that had a low RNA quality score were eliminated from the set.  

In the dataset we'll now look at, I'm not performing any filtering step.  

The code is a bit extensive, partly because it hasn't been cleaned up with common functions.  It's not shown in the .html nor .md versions of this file.  It can be seen in the .Rmd version.

```

## 1. Process the 4 datasets (stageOne, stageTwo, stageThree, stageFour)
I'll process these datasets the same way as I did above.  I'm still using the ZEROGENES that were defined by the training data for gene filtering.  And I'm still using the Reference Sample defined in the training set for calculating the sample-to-sample scaling factors.

## Other TCGA Sample Sensitivity
METHODOLOGY: Processing samples as above, with:  
1. The filtering of genes defined by the training set  

2. The sample-to-sample scaling factors done relative to a Reference Sample defined
in the training set  

3. The centering and scaling of each gene about its mean and standard deviation, 
respectively, within the dataset at hand.

table(stageFourOutcome, stage4Preds)
```
## We are getting terrible performance!  Why?
It has to do with the centering and scaling of each gene about its mean and standard deviation.
Let's look at a figure, where for the first 10 gene predictors (out of a total of 42), we create a boxplot
for  
(a) all 287 training samples (red)  
(b) just the 139 healthy training samples (green)  
(c) just the 148 training tumors (blue)  
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
numCols <-10
fullTrainPredictors <- LogRegModel$modelDF[,1:numCols]
healthyTrainPredictors <- fullTrainPredictors[1:139,]
tumorTrainPredictors <- fullTrainPredictors[140:287,]

trainPredictorsMelt <- cbind(rbind(melt(fullTrainPredictors), melt(healthyTrainPredictors), 
                             melt(tumorTrainPredictors)), class=c(rep("All", numCols*287), 
                                                            rep("Healthy", numCols*139), 
                                                            rep("Tumor", numCols*148)))
ggplot(trainPredictorsMelt, aes(x=Var2, y=value, fill=class)) + geom_boxplot() +
   ylim(-2,2) + theme_bw() +
   xlab("Gene Predictors") + ylab("Number of STDEV of Expression vs Mean")
```
This figure illustrates the problem we're having quite well.  
The gene-level centering and scaling we just performed on the Stage I-IV TCGA tumors was done based ONLY on the tumor data for each gene (blue boxplot).  However, the training model was created based on the gene-level normalization from the red boxplot.  

Looking at the gene on the left (FAM89B), we see that the mean across healthy sample and tumors is about -0.25, but amongst only the tumors, the mean is about +0.45.  What that means is that there will be many samples whose FAM89B level lies between -0.25 and +0.45.  In these cases, they would have had POSITIVE post-normalization values if all samples had been used, but NEGATIVE values if just the tumor samples had been used.  In these cases, the data would have been working counter to the model due to erroneous gene-level centering and scaling.  

Looking at the figure, we see that this issue is relevant for many genes.  

If this is true, then it should be the case that if we take the mean and standard deviation for all 42 genes in the training set (red boxplot) and apply these numbers to the gene-level centering and scaling of the Stage I-IV Predictions, our model performance should greatly improve.

### Testing the Gene-Level Centering and Scaling Hypothesis
We start out by calculating the gene-level means and standard deviations for all genes *in the training set*.  We then apply these values for the Stage I-IV test sets
```{r}
REF_MEANS <- apply(train$M_filtScaled, 2, mean)
REF_SDS <- apply(train$M_filtScaled, 2, sd)
```

```{r}
# stage 1 only   
#stageOne <- createDAT(stageOneDF)
tmp <- filterScaleNormalizePredict(stageOne, REF_MEANS, REF_SDS, 
                                           train, LogRegModel, TRUE)
stage1Preds <- tmp$pred ; stageOneFull <- tmp$DAT
table(stageOneOutcome, stage1Preds)
```
```{r}
# stage 2 only   
#stageTwo <- createDAT(stageTwoDF)
tmp <- filterScaleNormalizePredict(stageTwo, REF_MEANS, REF_SDS, 
                                           train, LogRegModel, TRUE)
stage2Preds <- tmp$pred ; stageTwoFull <- tmp$DAT
table(stageTwoOutcome, stage2Preds)
```

```{r}
# stage 3 only   
#stageThree <- createDAT(stageThreeDF)
tmp <- filterScaleNormalizePredict(stageThree, REF_MEANS, REF_SDS, 
                                           train, LogRegModel, TRUE)
stage3Preds <- tmp$pred ; stageThreeFull <- tmp$DAT
table(stageThreeOutcome, stage3Preds)
```
```{r}
# stage 4 only   
#stageFour <- createDAT(stageFourDF)
tmp <- filterScaleNormalizePredict(stageFour, REF_MEANS, REF_SDS, 
                                           train, LogRegModel, TRUE)
stage4Preds <- tmp$pred ; stageFourFull <- tmp$DAT
table(stageFourOutcome, stage4Preds)
```
We see that our results are greatly improved!  The sensitivity is not proportional nor inversely proportional to the stage of the disease.  Overall, we have a sensitivity of 99.1%!

## Principal Components Plot of Cancer Stage
I'd like to see how well the first 2 principal components separate out the tumors of various stages.
I'm going to catenate all datasets of the 4 stages of cancer and then create the PC plot.  

Earlier work used the ZEROGENES identified by the training set to filter the other various test sets.  However, since I'm going to make a new set of PC plots, it's important to not have genes whose SD is 0.001, as the outliers will dominate the variance.  Therefore, I'll start fresh with the concatenated tumor samples, create a training set from that, and proceed from there.  
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
prognosis4stage <- c(rep(1, nrow(stageOneFull$M_orig)), rep(2, nrow(stageTwoFull$M_orig)),
  rep(3, nrow(stageThreeFull$M_orig)), rep(4, nrow(stageFourFull$M_orig)))
df4stages_orig <- rbind(stageOneFull$M_orig, stageTwoFull$M_orig, 
                   stageThreeFull$M_orig, stageFourFull$M_orig)

#dim(df4stages_orig) # 884 x 60498

# random sampling of 147 samples that are stage 2-4 tumors:
set.seed(329832)
sg234Idx <- sample(which(prognosis4stage!=T), nrow(stageOne$M_orig))  

# grab all stage one sample plus the selected stage 2-4 samples
multiStage_orig <- df4stages_orig[c(1:nrow(stageOne$M_orig),sg234Idx),]

# need outcome and updated prognosis4stage
prognosisMultiStage <- c(rep(1,nrow(stageOne$M_orig)),prognosis4stage[sg234Idx])
outcomeStage <- c(rep(0, nrow(stageOne$M_orig)),
                  rep(1, length(prognosis4stage[sg234Idx])))

# now split into training and test sets
set.seed(SEED)
idxTrain <- caTools::sample.split(outcomeStage, SplitRatio = 0.75)
train4stage_orig <- multiStage_orig[idxTrain==T,]
test4stage_orig <- multiStage_orig[idxTrain==F,]
train4stage_outcome <- outcomeStage[idxTrain==T]
test4stage_outcome <- outcomeStage[idxTrain==F]
progn4stage <- prognosisMultiStage[idxTrain==T]

# add train4stage and test4stage to DAT structure
train4stage <- createDAT(train4stage_orig)
test4stage <- createDAT(test4stage_orig)

# add other variables and process new dataset
train4stage$outcome <- train4stage_outcome
test4stage$outcome <- test4stage_outcome

train4stage$M_nat <- natural(train4stage)

#hist(apply(train4stage$M_orig, 2, function(x) quantile(x)[4]), breaks=100, main="Histogram of each gene's 75th quantile of expression.", xlab="log2(Est Counts)")

tmp <- filterGenes(train4stage)
train4stage$ZEROGENES <- tmp[[1]]; train4stage$M_filt <- tmp[[2]]

tmp <- pickRefSample(train4stage)
train4stage$M_scaled <- tmp[[2]]; train4stage$RefSampleName <- tmp[[1]]

train4stage$M_filtScaled <- weightedTrimmedMean(train4stage)

train4stage$M_norm <- normalizeGenes(train4stage$M_filtScaled, TRUE, FALSE)

# clean up memory
rm(stageOne, stageOneFull, stageTwo, stageTwoFull, stageThree, stageThreeFull,
   stageFour, stageFourFull)
```
### Create PC Graph 

```{r, dpi=300}
PCs <- prcomp(train4stage$M_norm)                             # (data already scaled)
nComp <- 2
dfComponents <- predict(PCs, newdata=train4stage$M_norm)[,1:nComp]

PC_plot <- data.frame(x=dfComponents[,1], y = dfComponents[,2], col=progn4stage)
colors4pal <- c(rev(viridis::viridis(5)[2:5]))

ggplot(PC_plot) + 
   geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color=as.factor(col))) + 
   ggtitle("PCA Plot of Stage I-IV Data Using All Filtered Predictors") +
   xlab("PC1") + ylab("PC2") + theme_bw() + 
   scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                      breaks = c("1", "2", "3", "4"),
                      values = c(colors4pal[1], colors4pal[2], colors4pal[3], colors4pal[4]),
                      labels = c("Stage I", "Stage II", "Stage III", "Stage IV"))
```
I'm seeing poor separation looking at only PC1 and PC2.  Let's try all pair-wise combinations between PC1 and PC5.
```{r, fig.height=14, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
# THIS FUNCTION HAS SOME HARD-CODED PARAMETERS:
plotPCs4col <- function(dfComponents, compIdx){
   PC_plot <- data.frame(x=dfComponents[,compIdx[1]], y = dfComponents[,compIdx[2]], col=progn4stage)
   colors4pal <- c(rev(viridis::viridis(5)[2:5]))
   obj <<- ggplot(PC_plot) + 
      geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color=as.factor(col)), alpha=0.6) + 
      ggtitle("PCA Plot of Training Data Using All Filtered Predictors of Toil Training Data") +
      xlab(paste0("PC",compIdx[1])) + ylab(paste0("PC", compIdx[2])) +
      theme_bw() + 
      scale_color_manual(name="Category",
                         breaks = c("1", "2", "3", "4"),
                         values = c(colors4pal[1], colors4pal[2], colors4pal[3], colors4pal[4]),
                         labels = c("Stage I", "Stage II", "Stage III", "Stage IV"));
   return(obj)
}

nComp <- 5
dfComponents <- predict(PCs, newdata=train4stage$M_norm)[,1:nComp]

ls <- list()
pairs <- combn(nComp,2)
for(idx in 1:ncol(pairs)){
   pair <- pairs[,idx]
   ls[[idx]] <- plotPCs4col(dfComponents, pair)                  # Add a MAIN TITLE and remove other titles
}
grid.arrange(ls[[1]], ls[[2]], ls[[3]], ls[[4]], ls[[5]], ls[[6]],
             ls[[7]], ls[[8]], ls[[9]], ls[[10]], ncol=2)
```
While the combination of PC2 and PC5 tend to disperse the sample classes better than other pairs of the top PCs, the samples from the 4 stages of cancer are on top of one another.  It seems that PC5 alone does some separation of stage I from the others.  

No 2 PCs at the top partition these 4 stages of cancer, or even close, but perhaps a much richer model will.  
So let's go back to logistic regression with the lasso classifier, to see if class I from the other 3 classes, as class I has a reasonable number of examples, unless class IV.  
```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)
fitToil.lasso <- glmnet(train4stage$M_norm, train4stage$outcome, family="binomial",
                           alpha = 1)
plot(fitToil.lasso, xvar="lambda", label=TRUE)
```
We can immediately see that this Lasso model has MANY more predictors than the healthy-tumor lasso model at the same value of log-λ.  

### Cross-Validating the Model to Pick the Smallest, Well-Performing Model
I'm going to look at cross-validating the model in order to pick the simplest one that performs well.
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)                                # need same seed as previous step
cv.Toil.lasso <- cv.glmnet(train4stage$M_norm, train4stage$outcome
                           , family="binomial", alpha=1) 
plot(cv.Toil.lasso)
```
It appears that we're looking at a very small model that's within 1 stdev of the minimum.  I'm guessing we'll have a not-very-good performance.

#### Grab the coefficients and store the model
```{r}
coefsToil <- coef(cv.Toil.lasso, s=cv.Toil.lasso$lambda.1se)

LogRegModel <- storeMODEL(coefsToil, train=train4stage)
```
The chosen model has only 8 predictors, all with small coefficients (< 0.1).

#### Prepare the test set
```{r}
test4stage$M_nat <- natural(test4stage)

# subtract off ZEROGENES as defined in training set
test4stage$M_filt <- test4stage$M_nat[, -train4stage$ZEROGENES]

tmp <- pickRefSample(test4stage)            # only doing this to get scaled data
test4stage$M_scaled <- tmp[[2]]; 
test4stage$RefSampleName <- train4stage$RefSampleName # RefSampleName from train set
test4stage$M_filtScaled <- weightedTrimmedMean(test4stage, train4stage, 1) # filtered & scaled

test4stage$M_norm <- normalizeGenes(test4stage$M_filtScaled, TRUE, FALSE)
```
#### Remove Non-Predictor Genes from Filtered Test Data and Calculate Accuracy
We're just keeping the 8 predictors 
```{r}
colIDs <- which(colnames(test4stage$M_norm) %in% 
               LogRegModel$predFullNames[2:length(LogRegModel$predFullNames)])
test4stagePred <- test4stage$M_norm[,colIDs]              # SEPARATE FROM OBJECT

test4stagePred <- cbind(rep(1,nrow(test4stagePred)), test4stagePred)

test4stagePredictions <- ifelse(test4stagePred %*% LogRegModel$predCoefs > 0, 1, 0)
table(test4stage$outcome, test4stagePredictions)
```
These results show that I have absolutely no sensitivity nor specificity.  The accuracy is 55%.

## Support Vector Machine
Given how the data are on top of each other in the PC plot, I'm going to see if SVM can tease apart the data a bit.

```{r, dpi=300}
require(e1071)
#svmfit <- svm(factor(train4stage$outcome) ~., data=train4stage$M_norm, 
#              kernel="radial", cost=5, scale=F)

# STACK OVERFLOW

# this is getting a stack overflow.  So I'll just remove some predictors and see
# if it'll complete
# Let's calculate the first 10 PCs across each sample and see if we can run svm on it.
pcDat <- data.frame(cbind(PCs$x[,1:10], outcome=train4stage$outcome))
svmfit <- svm(outcome ~., data=pcDat, kernel="radial", cost=5, scale=F, 
              probability=T, type='C-classification')

# convert test set into the PCs defined by training set:
testSetPCs <- predict(PCs, newdata=test4stage$M_norm)[,1:10]
testPred <- predict(svmfit, testSetPCs,decision.values = T)    # getting 1.5 everywhere!!


# let's even look at training data accuracy:
trainPred <- ifelse(predict(svmfit, pcDat %>% dplyr::select(-outcome)) < 0.5, 0, 1) # only works with outcome var!
table(train4stage$outcome, trainPred)              # 100% not believable.  plus the outcome var still there.

# probably should do something to select cost parameters.  See ISLR book
tune.out <- tune(svm, outcome ~., data=pcDat, kernel="radial",
                 ranges=list(cost=c(0.001,0.01,0.1,1,5,10,100)))
summary(tune.out)
bestModel <- tune.out$best.model
summary(bestModel)
ypred <- ifelse(predict(bestModel, testSetPCs) < 1.5, 1, 2)
table(test4stage$outcome, ypred)
```
(22+18)/(22+18+15+19)
I'm getting terrible results.

#### try training set again with bestModel
```{r}
yTrainPred <- ifelse(predict(bestModel, pcDat %>% dplyr::select(-outcome)) < 1.5, 0, 1)
table(train4stage$outcome, yTrainPred)
```
77% training set accuracy compared with 54% test set accuracy.  So I'm over-fitting a bit.

#### I'm still really surprised that I didn't do a lot better with just PC2 and PC5.
#### Let's try again.

#### Ridge Regression Trial
```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)
fit4stage.ridge <- glmnet(train4stage$M_norm, train4stage$outcome, family="binomial",
                           alpha = 0)                   # alpha = 0 for ridge
plot(fit4stage.ridge, xvar="lambda", label=TRUE)
```
#### Ridge Regression Cross-Validation
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=300}
set.seed(SEED2)                                # need same seed as previous step
cv.4stage.ridge <- cv.glmnet(train4stage$M_norm, train4stage$outcome
                           , family="binomial", alpha=0) 
plot(cv.4stage.ridge)
```
#### Picking best Ridge Model and Determining Test Set Accuracy
```{r}
coefs4stage <- coef(cv.4stage.ridge, s=cv.4stage.ridge$lambda.1se)
test4stageM <- cbind(rep(1,nrow(test4stage$M_norm)), test4stage$M_norm)
test4stagePred <- ifelse((test4stageM %*% coefs4stage) < 0, 0, 1)
table(test4stage$outcome, test4stagePred)
```
This gives us a test set accuracy of (23+20)/74 = 58%.  Better, but not great.

#### Do samples cluster together?
I'm going to look at k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering
```{r, dpi=300}
require(ape)
train4stageDist <- dist(train4stage$M_norm)
hclust.avg <- hclust(train4stageDist, method="average")
plot(hclust.avg, cex=0.2, col=progn4stage)
plot(as.phylo(hclust.avg), type="unrooted", cex=0.2, no.margin=T)
```
