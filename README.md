# MachineLearningRNASeq

In this repository we're applying a variety of machine learning algorithms on a Breast Cancer Dataset derived from TCGA and GTEx samples.  
[1. Using Lasso regularizing term with Logistic Regression to Predict Disease State.](Lasso_on_BRCA_RNASeq.md)  
[2. Performing QA to determine if normalization could be improving prediction performance.](Lasso2.md)  
[3. Examining potential problematic batch normalization via looking at pre-Combat data.](Toil_Norm.md)
